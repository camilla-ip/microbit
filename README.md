# microbit projects

## Introduction

The [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a pocket-sized computer created by the BBC to help people learn about computing.

The current device, "micro:bit v2", and includes six sensors for:
1. motion
2. temperature
3. light
4. magnetism
5. sound
6. touch

It also has a:
* wireless radio communication
* lights, and
* buttons.
